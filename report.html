<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>American woodcock (<em>Scolopax minor</em>; hereinafter woodcock),
one of the most common species of shorebirds in eastern North America
(McAuley et al.), is an early successional habitat specialist whose
populations are declining throughout their range (Bergian). Because it
is one of the only shorebird species in North America that reside in
habitats not adjacent to water during migration, the land mass of
potential suitable habitats for this species is far greater than other
water-dependent birds in Order Charadriiformes such as dunlin
(<em>Calidris alpina</em>) or semipalmated plover (<em>Charadrius
semipalmatus</em>). As a result, woodcocks are more easily stumbled upon
in close proximity to human activities: during woodland hikes, county
road drives, morning park jogs, or nighttime camps.</p>
<p>Along with its significance of being an umbrella species - a
representative of an ecosystem specifically for conservation purposes
that protects other species within its ecosystem - the woodcock is also
one of the highly sought-after shorebird species among naturalists and
birders due to its appearance, behavior, and relatively difficulty of
detection. In addition, its ‘dance’ moves has made it into an internet
favorite when paired with a wide array of music on social media
(Farley). Thus, it has become a curious inquiry to members of science
community, policy makers, and the general public for the ecological,
temporal, and spatial factors that may affect the chances one could
encounter a woodcock in the wild.</p>
<p>For this project, we demonstrated the observational data in various
ways in response to scientific questions on detection of woodcocks,
along with creating a prediction model using variables both included in
the observational data and inferred using latitude and longitude
information. Our charts showed the power of citizen science data and the
multitude of analyses that the data enables researchers and scientists
to explore and answer new questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Data &amp; Methods</h2>
<div id="ebird-data" class="section level3">
<h3>2.1 eBird data</h3>
<p>eBird (ebird.org) is an online citizen science platform for bird
observations developed by Cornell Lab of Ornithology (Sullivan et al.).
Users can submit observations in the form of a birding checklist, which
records the time, distance, duration, location, species observed, and
species counts for each birding outing. With over 35,000 checklists
submitted daily, eBird has congregated a sizeable amount of data capable
of allowing comprehensie data analysis in various field within or
adjacent to ornithology.</p>
<p>The observational and sampling data in the form of individual
checklists on the platform, eBird Basic Dataset (EBD), is publicly
available and is downloaded after submitting a request to download the
data of woodcocks. Due to the large file size and limited CPU powers,
the dataset is limited to observations from January 2019 to January 2024
in New York State.</p>
<p>eBird data is then processed using the <code>auk</code> package
(Strimas-Mackey et al.) for data visualization and processing. The .txt
files were loaded into R, and the shared checklists were collapsed to
eliminate replicated observations. The non-complete checklists were then
filtered to ensure data cleaniness. The zero-filling method is then used
to infer non-detections using the sampling data. Some of the variables
were transformed for modeling: time is converted to a decimal value, and
a variable for speed is created. Checklists too long or too fast were
eliminated.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-integration---add-environmental-variables"
class="section level3">
<h3>2.2 Data Integration - Add Environmental Variables</h3>
<p>The overall goal of this process is to get the weather information
and land cover data at the places where observations occur, as these are
hypothetical factors that may influence the distribution of
timberdoodles, and will be used in our model. We use weather data from
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (see details at
<strong><a
href="https://www.noaa.gov/">https://www.noaa.gov/</a>)</strong>, an use
land cover data from<strong><a
href="https://www.mrlc.gov/">Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics
(MRLC) Consortium</a></strong>.</p>
<p>For weather data we used two datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/">Yearly
weather records data</a></strong>: The daily weather records from each
weather station, including tmax (max temperature in degree Celsius),
tmin (min temperature in degree Celsius), prcp (precipitation), snow
(snow in mm), snwd (snow depth in mm)) from 2019-2024; Though may other
kinds of weather information are included, we don’t consider them in our
model.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><a
href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt">Station
location data</a></strong>: A dataset match the station ids with
locations (latitude, longitude)</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the weather data are recorded by weather stations, which are
not necessarily at the same place with bird observations. Therefore, we
assign the nearest weather station within 50 km to the places of
observation. To realize the goal. We first merge the weather records
from each weather station from 2019-2024 with the dataset indicating the
location of each weather station by station id. Then we added the
weather records from the nearest weather station to the bird observation
dataset by date and location (i.e. latitude &amp; longitude).</p>
<p>For land cover data, we use a tif file. To integrate the land cover
data from the GeoTIFF raster file into the observation CSV file, the
observation dataset was first converted into an sf spatial object using
its longitude and latitude columns. Next, the coordinate reference
system (CRS) of the sf object was aligned with the CRS of the raster
file to ensure compatibility. Then, land cover values were extracted
from the raster based on the observation coordinates. Finally, these
extracted land cover values were added as a new column to the original
dataset, which was then saved as a CSV file for further
analysis.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Modeling</h2>
<div id="data-preporecessing-and-modeling" class="section level3">
<h3>3.1 Data preporecessing and modeling</h3>
<p>This analysis used eBird data with environmental variables to
calculate the observation ratio (obs_ratio) for modeling. Average
temperature (t_avg) and snowfall (snow) were grouped into intervals (1°C
and 5 units, respectively), with flag variables created for each range.
Observations within the same flag were counted and normalized by the
total observations, providing the proportion of American Woodcock
sightings under specific conditions.</p>
<p>After grouping and flagging the data, a linear model was used to fit
the data, with environmental variables as the predictors and obs_ratio
as the target variable.</p>
</div>
<div id="preiction-data-simulation" class="section level3">
<h3>3.2 Preiction data simulation</h3>
<p>For continuous variables such as tmax, tmin, snow, and snwd, we
fitted their distributions based on the original data and generated
simulated prediction data within the 95% confidence interval. Realistic
constraints were also incorporated, such as ensuring tmax is always
greater than tmin, southern regions having higher temperatures than
northern regions, and snowfall being lower in southern areas compared to
the north.</p>
<p>Within each generated grid, 1,000 data points were simulated, with
their latitude and longitude constrained to lie within the respective
grid boundaries. Using the previously trained regression model, we
predicted the observation ratio (obs_ratio) for each point and summed
these values to obtain the total observation probability for each grid.
Additionally, realistic landcover data were assigned to each grid based
on its geographic location, further enhancing the accuracy and realism
of the simulated data to align with actual conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-optimization" class="section level3">
<h3>3.3 Model Optimization</h3>
<p>After constructing the full linear model, it was observed that the
model contained an excessive number of predictors, which could lead to
potential overfitting. To address this issue and optimize the final
model, three regularization methods—LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net—were
employed to perform predictor selection.</p>
<p>Upon identifying the optimized models recommended by each of the
three methods and comparing the weights assigned to all retained
predictors, we found that the predictor <em>landcover</em>, while
initially deemed significant in the summary results of the full linear
model, was assigned near-zero weights across all three optimization
methods. This indicates that <em>landcover</em> contributes minimally to
the model. Therefore, to maintain model simplicity, it is recommended to
exclude this predictor.</p>
</div>
<div id="griding-and-heating-map-ploting" class="section level3">
<h3>3.4 Griding and heating map ploting</h3>
<p>We applied grid operations to the map of New York State, dividing it
into grids to more precisely identify bird observation locations and
simulate real-world conditions. After multiple adjustments, a grid size
of 0.1 was selected as the optimal scale.The final observation
probabilities of the American woodcock are displayed in the form of a
heatmap.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>4. Results</h2>
<p>Preliminary exploratory analysis were carried out to answer some
common questions related to woodcock detection within New York State. By
creating a <code>season</code> factor and creating a bar chart showing
the number of checklists per season, we visualized the total amount and
the difference in number of observations of woodcocks each season. The
observation counts were also categorized by time of day to see if there
is any significant pattern in time of the day for detection. Then, a
chi-squared test is run to test whether the differences between season
and day times are significant. Also, the number of observations is also
summarized by county.</p>
<p>We were able to observe a significant</p>

<div id="conclusion-and-discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>5. Conclusion and Discussion</h2>
<p>Overall, we harnessed the power of citizen science data to both
answer various questions on sightings of a rather secrete question and
create a comprehensive prediction model using various temporal and
spatial factors for the abundance in any given place in New York state.
We used a charismatic species that is well-known in naturalist and
birder community as well as anyone using social media as an example to
display our methods in exploring such citizen science data; the same
visualizations and analyses that we demonstrated can be easily
duplicated for other species and observations, or even non-wildlife data
such as occurrence of a disease or the tracking of all crimes in a
city.</p>
<p>where effort data are not available, in some situations occupancy
models may be a more robust modelling approach</p>
<p>analysing complete checklists and using effort variables as
covariates made the largest difference to the model quality</p>
<p>the raw data, the volume of data, the model type and the modelling
objective will all affect the relative benefit of the data processing
steps that we describe. (Johnston et al.)</p>
<p>Data selection has been, and will always be a</p>
<p>One possibility is that checklist submission might be driven by the
availability of public green spaces where birders are attracted (Lopez
et al.)</p>
<p>road density to be negatively associated with the sampling intensity
across multiple taxa (Mair and Ruete)</p>
<p>how selected sampling can lead to incorrect inferences about the
relationship between variables of interest (Grade et al.)</p>
<p>Within the scope of time and the previous background and experience
in computational and ornithological knowledge, we were able to uncover a
plethora of results that would otherwise well hidden inside the data
set. However, a deeper dive into the more fine-tuned ecology and
micro-habitats of the woodcock (or other species that reside in
successional habitats that favor areas with more urban development) is
needed to provide enough precision for the prediction model suitable for
ornithological research.</p>
